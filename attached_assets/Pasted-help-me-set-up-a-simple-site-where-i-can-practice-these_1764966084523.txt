What is the result of combining a string with a number? Chapter 3 Answers

1.

The tag used is <?php...?>. It can be shortened to <?...?>, but that is not recommended practice.



2.

You can use // for a single-line comment or /*...*/ to span multiple lines.



3.

All PHP statements must end with a semicolon (;).



4.

With the exception of constants, all PHP variables must begin with $.



5.

A variable holds a value that can be a string, a number, or other data.



6.

$variable = 1 is an assignment statement, whereas the == in $variable == 1 and the === in $variable === 1 is a comparison operator. Use $variable = 1 to set the value of $variable. Use $variable === 1 to find out later in the program whether $variable equals the number 1. If you use $variable == 1, it returns true even if $variable is a string "1", which can cause unexpected bugs. If you mistakenly use $variable = 1 where you meant to do a comparison, it will do two things you probably don’t want: set $variable to 1 and return a true value all the time, no matter its previous value.



7.

In PHP, the hyphen is reserved for the subtraction, decrement, and negation operators. A construct like $current-user would be harder to interpret if hyphens were also allowed in variable names, and in any case would lead programs to be ambiguous.



8.

Yes, variable names are case-sensitive. $This_Variable is not the same as $this_variable.



9.

You cannot use spaces in variable names, as this would confuse the PHP parser. Instead, try using the _ (underscore), or use camelCase notation.



10.

You can use type casting to convert the type, for example like $number = (int)$string. However, if type declarations are not used and you want to convert one variable type to another, reference it and PHP will automatically convert it for you.



11.

There is no difference between ++$j and $j++ unless the value of $j is being tested, assigned to another variable, or passed as a parameter to a function. In such cases, ++$j increments $j before the test or other operation is performed, whereas $j++ performs the operation and then increments $j.



12.

Generally, the operators && and and are interchangeable except where precedence is important, in which case && has a high precedence, while and has a low one.



13.

You can use multiple lines within quotation marks or the <<<_END..._END; construct to create a multiline echo or assignment. In the latter case, the closing tag must be on a line by itself with nothing before or after it.



14.

You cannot redefine constants because, by definition, once defined they retain their value until the program terminates.



15.

You can use \' or \" to escape either a single or double quote.



16.

The echo and print commands are similar in that they are both constructs, except that print behaves like a PHP function and takes a single argument, while echo can take multiple arguments.



17.

The purpose of functions is to separate discrete sections of code into their own self-contained sections that can be referenced by a single function name.



18.

You can make a variable accessible to all parts of a PHP program by declaring it as global. However this is not a recommended approach in production code.



19.

If you generate data within a function, you can convey the data to the rest of the program by returning a value or modifying a global variable.

What command can you use to skip the current iteration of a loop and move on to the next one?

What’s the difference between the for loop and the while loop?

How do if and while statements interpret conditional expressions of different data types? Chapter 4 Answers

1.

When converting to string, TRUE is represented as the string value "1", and FALSE is represented as an empty string, so "1" and "" will be printed instead.



2.

The simplest forms of expressions are literals (such as numbers and strings) and variables, which simply evaluate to themselves.



3.

The difference between unary, binary, and ternary operators is the number of operands each requires (one, two, and three, respectively).



4.

The best way to force your own operator precedence is to place parentheses around subexpressions that you wish to give high precedence.



5.

Operator associativity refers to the direction of processing (left to right or right to left).



6.

Use the identity operator when you wish to avoid PHP’s automatic operand type changing (also called type casting), and the bugs it could introduce.



7.

The three conditional statement types are if, switch, and the ?: operator.



8.

To skip the current iteration of a loop and move to the next one, use a continue statement.



9.

The difference between for and while is that loops using for statements support two additional parameters to control the loop handling.



10.

Most conditional expressions in if and while statements are literals (or Booleans) and therefore trigger execution when they evaluate to TRUE. Numeric expressions trigger execution when they evaluate to a nonzero value. String expressions trigger execution when they evaluate to a nonempty string. A NULL value is evaluated as false and therefore does not trigger execution.
